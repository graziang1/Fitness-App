      <strong>Fitness At Ease</strong> was founded in August of 2020 by Gianna Graziano.
      Gianna loved seeing her friends at her local gym, but some were a bit too distracting... 
      from the elaborate conversations to the constant social media posts mid-exercise, she couldn't take much more.
      Gianna didn't want to be rude to her friends, yet she wanted a way to complete her workouts in peace!
      With her computer science background and love for the fitness world, it was only fitting for her to create a fitness app.
